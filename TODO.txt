Still TODOs:
--- Output of 0th-cycle quantities

--- Diagnostic file (SummaryQuantities) with user-defined diagnostics

--- Activate writing of cell-center quantities (i.e. B) for restart

Done:
--- Distinguish deposit for normal cycle and deposit for output (hat
quantities for normal cycle, non-hat for output cycle ON TOP OF hatted stuff);
even better to make a dedicated deposit routine only called at output time

--- Check all factors of c throghout the code
