This explains how to use proc2vtr.py python script to convert iPic3D HDF5 output to vtr.
If you have sudo permissions on your linux machine, you can skip the installation part.

1. Installing python and necessary libraries.

Install your favourite distribution of Python (if it's not installed yet).
I recommend the one from Enthought: http://www.enthought.com/products/epd.php

Install the libraries: scipy, tables, vtk, mpi4py. 
The EPD python distribution from Enthought already has everything except the mpi4py.

Installing mpi4py (http://mpi4py.scipy.org/) could be a mess, and should be managed individually in each case.
On the ESAT computer at KU Leuven with CentOS Linux I found the following option the easisest:
 - Install the EPD Python locally (don't need sudo)
 - $PATH=EPDP_Python_prefix/bin/:$PATH
 - download mpi4py, unzip, untar
 - go to the folder with unpacked libs, run:
   $ python setup.py build
   $ python setup.py install
If there are errors... google!
I found out that it doesn't work with MPICH2 on neither 64 bit CentOS, or 64 bit Win7.

2. Running the script.

In iPic3D directory (check out from svn) there is folder "python" that contains file "proc2vtr.py".
You'll have to set a few parameters in the file (see comments inside), like data directory and number of cycles in your run.
Then execute:

$ mpirun -n 4 python proc2vtr.py
